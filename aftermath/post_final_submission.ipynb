    "This notebook documents our exploration for the <a href=\"http://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza\">Random Acts of Pizza</a> kaggle competition as part of the W207 Machine Learning course for UC Berkeley's MIDS program. We document the individual areas of exploration that we completed for this project, followed by the larger model that pulled these explorations together.\n",

    "### Problem Description\n",
    "The goal of the Random Acts of Pizza kaggle projects is to translate requests for pizza on the Reddit group \"Random Acts of Pizza\" in to predictions of whether or not they those requests are fulfilled. The data includes the text request, split in to the title and body of requests for pizza, as well as metadata about the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metadata include:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>time of request (UTC and local)\n",
    "<li>numeric data about user activity:\n",

    "# TODO / Notes\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> DONE Look at success of title + body - not a major determinant of success or not\n",
    "<li> DONE Try word vec vars with L1 regularization - did not add much value over body max + min with ETC\n",
    "<li> DONE Implement a nonlinear layer over each word vector then max pool the results of that layer then pass to softmax / LR layer - Ran on One Train/Test split and there seems to be significant improvement peaking at ROC AUC of 0.619 around 50 - 70 epochs.\n",
    "<li> DONE Script to save experiments. Goal - recover inputs to experiments and results. Execution - save final NN, any training inputs, and occasional results on train and test.\n",
    "<li> DONE Try NN on all k-folds - not an improvement over bag of words - best median kfold was about a ROC AUC of 0.58 after about 40k training steps\n",
    "<li> DONE: add regularization\n",
    "<li> DONE: train and test kfolds with regularizations - regularizaiton with rho = 1e-3 is a slight improvement, leading to mean/median ROC AUC of about 0.584 after 40k training steps instead of 0.58\n",
    "<li> DONE: add dropout - after adding dropout and 200 dimension hidden layer, I got a median ROC AUC of 60 (after 40k examples), but the 0th iteration ROC AUC was 57 which is confusing - maybe just a really good intial weight configuration?\n",
    "<li> DONE: try 200 dim hidden layer without drop out and 100 dim hidden layer with drop out for comparison - 100 dim hidden layer with drop out seemed to be best\n",
    "<li> DONE: try changing the random seed and re running hdim 200 with drop out to see if results differ - indeed results were worse. with the original random seed (207) roc auc plateaued around 60 after 40k-80k examples. with another random seed (414) roc auc plateaued around 58.2 after 40k-80k examples. I think the problem is random weight initialization. Another symptom of this problem is that iteration 0 scores for train set differed in a big way between random seeds - suggsets to me that random weights were too high after increasing number of dimensions. Trying with new random weight scheme (fan in / fan out adjusted instead of just a random number).\n",
    "<li> DONE: random weight adjusted by fan in / fan out - dev set results seems to fluctuate less given differnt random seed after changing this, results slightly more consistent. seed 207 still plateaus around 60 between 40k-80k. same for seed 414.\n",
    "<li> DONE: minibatch training - No minibatch (mb=1) was definitely best, and progressively larger minibatches were worse. It's possible that other choices might make minibatches more attractive, for examplie different alpha or equal-weighted class samples, might leave this for later exploration.\n",
    "<li> DONE: try different learning rates and annealed learning. I investigated different learning rats and annealed learning. The best static rates are between 0.005 and 0.001. Annealed learning works best starting at 0.005 and annealing every 10 epochs or so.\n",
    "<li> DONE: try bigger word vectors - did not add any value. higher regularization improved results a bit for bigger word vectors. did not try different learning rates.\n",
    "<li> TODO: add more convolution (bi grams etc)\n",
    "<li> DONE: deeper layers before max pooling\n",
    "<li> TODO: dropout softmax layer too\n",
    "<li> DONE: deeper layers after max pooling\n",
    "<li> DONE: IMplement CNN\n",
    "<li> TODO: Test CNN\n",
    "<li> TODO: Improve testing so that all kfolds are saved in a single folder which gets around the painful regex I currently do. Folder name should be the opts that were called and have the time at the end. This makes it easy to group things that were called together\n",
    "<li> TODO: Implement RCNN in Lai Et.Al 2015\n",
    "<li> NOTE: Overfitting is not a problem when there are two hidden layers before max pooling. The train set ROC AUC seems to max out around 60, whether I use drop out or not. If I drop one of those hidden layers it becomes a problem again (especially if no dropout), even if I keep an extra hidden layer after max pooling. "
